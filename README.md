# .NET SDK Test Runner

A standalone application for automating .NET SDK test execution on Windows VMs. Ships as a single portable folder, no Python or Node.js required on the target machine.

## Quick Start (End Users)

**Requirements:** Windows 10/11 (x64) + .NET SDK installed

1. Copy the `dotnet-test-runner` folder to your VM
2. Run `dotnet-test-runner.exe`
3. Opens in a native window by default (falls back to the browser at http://localhost:5000 if the native UI is unavailable)

To force browser/web mode, set the environment variable `APP_MODE=web` before launching. `APP_MODE=native` (the default) uses the native window.

## Usage

1. **Select tests** from the left panel (grouped by category)
2. **Click "Run Selected"** to execute
3. **Watch real-time logs** in the runner view (click a test name to scroll to its output)
4. **Review results** with pass/fail/skip counts
5. **Add custom tests** using the "+ Add Test" button

### Test Outcomes

Each test reports one of these outcomes:

- **Passed** ✓ — all steps succeeded with no warnings
- **Passed with warnings** ⚠ — all steps succeeded but the output contained an MSBuild/NuGet-style warning (e.g. `warning NU1903:` for a package with a known vulnerability). Counted separately from clean passes.
- **Failed** ✗ — a step returned an unexpected exit code or failed an output assertion
- **Skipped** — the test was cancelled before it ran

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites (build machine only)

- **Python 3.12** — [python.org](https://python.org)
- **Node.js 18+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (only if modifying the frontend)

### Build Steps

**Windows:**
```
build.bat
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```
./build.sh
```

Output: `dist/dotnet-test-runner/` folder containing the standalone executable.

### Rebuilding the Frontend

Only needed if you modify files in `frontend/src/`:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

This outputs static files to `backend/static/` which get bundled into the executable.

## Test Case Format

Tests are defined as YAML in `backend/test_definitions/`. Each test has:

```yaml
tests:
  - id: my-test-id
    category: "C# Console"
    title: "My Test"
    description: "What this tests"
    machine_mutating: false  # true if it modifies global state
    steps:
      - type: command
        command: "dotnet new console -o myapp"
        timeout: 60  # seconds (default: 120)
      - type: command
        command: "cd myapp"
      - type: command
        command: "dotnet build"
      - type: command
        command: "dotnet run"
        expected_exit_code: 0  # default
        assert_output_contains: ["Hello, World!"]
      - type: write_file
        path: "Program.cs"
        content: |
          using System;
          Console.WriteLine("Custom code");
```

### Step Types

| Type | Fields | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `command` | command, timeout, expected_exit_code, assert_output_contains, continue_on_error | Execute a CLI command |
| `write_file` | path, content | Write content to a file |

## Adding Tests via UI

1. Click "+ Add Test" in the nav bar
2. Fill in category and title (ID is auto-generated from the title)
3. Define steps as JSON array
4. Save, the test appears in the test list immediately
5. Custom tests can be deleted via the Delete button

## Security Note

This app executes commands on the local machine. It binds to **localhost only** (127.0.0.1) by default. Do not expose to a network.

## Development

For local development with hot-reload:

```
# Terminal 1 — backend
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Terminal 2 — frontend (with hot-reload)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend dev server runs on http://localhost:3000 and proxies API calls to port 5000.
